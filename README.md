This is a simple Convolutional Neural Network I created and trained to classify images into two categories: cheetah or hyena. 
I'm still looking for more ways to minimize lost faster and increase accuracy more rapidly including toggling learning rate, adjusting my transformers,
and modifying the dropout rate of neurons.


This is my first attempt at deep learning!
